# Rumble Chat Actor
Automatically interact with your Rumble livestream chats.

This project is currently just a Python module. It is fully functional, but you have to install the [Python Programming Language](https://python.org) and write your own little script to inport and use it.

This project requires the following python libraries:
- [Cocorum](https://pypi.org/project/cocorum/)
- [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
- [BrowserMob Proxy](https://pypi.org/project/browsermob-proxy)
- [MoviePy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests)
- [Talkey](https://pypi.org/project/talkey)

RumChat Actor itself is [on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/rumchat_actor), so once you have Python, installing it with `pip install rumchat-actor` should automatically download all dependencies.
Note that, if you are using Linux, you may have to install python3-pip separately. On Windows, Pip comes with Python.

Additional software requirements that aren't directly Python-related:
- [The Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

This is basically meant to be a FOSS local implementation of The Rumble Bot, and should run alongside your streaming software and / or other applications on most systems.

Here is an example usage script. Lines starting with # are comments. You would write a script like this, and save it as 'my_rumchat_actor_rig.py` or similar.
```
#First, import the module
import rumchat_actor

#Then, instantiate the Actor object.
#stream_id is either the base 10 or base 36 livestream ID you want the Actor to connect to, obtained from the popout chat or the Rumble Live Stream API.
#If stream_id is None but you pass api_url, the latest livestream shown on the API is chosen automatically.
#If you do not pass password, it will be requested
actor = rumchat_actor.RumbleChatActor(stream_id = STREAM_ID, username = USERNAME, password = PASSWORD)

#Let's set up a message action. A message action is a function called on every chat message.
#It is passed the cocorum.ssechat.SSEChatMessage object, and the RumbleChatActor object.

def eat_some_cheese(message, actor):
    '''If a message mentions cheese, eat some cheese'''
    if "cheese" in message.text.lower():
        actor.send_message(f"@{message.user.username} Eat some cheese ðŸ§€.")
    #Actions should return True if they had to delete a message.
    #This action does not delete messages, so leaving it at the Python default
    # of returning None is fine.

actor.register_message_action(eat_some_cheese)

#There are many ways to register commands. Internally, they all end up
# as some form of rumchat_actor.commands.ChatCommand().
#The simplest way is to instantiate a prebuilt modification of this class.
#Be sure to pass the actor object to the class when you instantiate it.

actor.register_command(rumchat_actor.commands.KillswitchCommand(actor))

#This KillswitchCommand, by the way, shuts down the actor when a mod or admin runs it.
#You can open the Python interpreter and run help("rumchat_actor.commands") to
# see info on other ChatCommand derivative classes.

#The other main way to register a command is via a simple callable.
#Like message actions, these are also passed SSEChatMEssage and RumbleChatActor
def tester(message, actor):
    '''Test command callable'''
    actor.send_message(f"Test command run by @{message.user.username}")

#You must provide a command name when you do this way.
actor.register_command(name = "tester", command = tester)

#Finally, once everything is registered, we call the actor's mainloop method
# to run it. When this is running, you can press Ctrl+C to exit,
# but it might take a moment to respond.
actor.mainloop()
```

You would write this script, and run it as your local Rumble Chat Actor instance. Note that it currently does not exit on its own when a livestream ends. It may also exit on its own if chat is inactive for a very long time.
Hope this helps!

Be sure to run `help("rumchat_actor")` in the Python interpreter to get more info on the various methods that are available.
I'll try to get some better documentation up soon. Hope this helps!
